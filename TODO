TODO:

globbing in dblist?

better handling of long errors?
i18n?
setup modes?
emulate mkdir -p?
allow char devs / fifos in cases where we currently test for -f?
 (but could cause problems with, e.g., rm...)
add on_startup_warn?
phone-home check for newer version?
  or auto-update?? (e.g., with 2x md5 and global lock)

do more to protect against leading - in settings?
