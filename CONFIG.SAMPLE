#    has begun
#
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "120" (2 hours)
#
###ifrunning=

#
# path to the alert-timestamp file (used to track ifrunning)
#
# * _not_ ignored, even if ifrunning=0
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "[lockfile].alert"; e.g., if lockfile is

# whatever string you use
#
# dates refer to when the script starts; all files created during a given

#
# this feature allows you to selectively override mysql_dumpoptions, but

#
# mysql_usealtopts can be "yes" or "no"
#
# if "yes", you must define a function called mysql_altopts which
#   - takes the name of a database
#   - returns 1 (false) if mysql_dumpoptions should be used
#   - otherwise, returns 0 (true) and sets a global array called altopts
#
# you can also set mysql_usealtopts to "yes" but not define the function,
# in which case the default is used (see below; see also the usage notes
# on the config file)
#
# alternate options completely override mysql_dumpoptions; any options
# set there must be repeated in the altopts array if they are to be used
#
# this feature is particularly useful for the special 'information_schema'
# DB - use the same options as in mysql_dumpoptions, plus
# '--skip-lock-tables'; however, note the following, from the mysqldump man
# page:
#     mysqldump does not dump the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database by default.
#     As of MySQL 5.1.38, mysqldump dumps INFORMATION_SCHEMA if you name it
#     explicitly on the command line, although you must also use the
#     --skip-lock-tables option. Before 5.1.38, mysqldump silently ignores
#     INFORMATION_SCHEMA even if you name it explicitly on the command
#     line.
#
# it can also be useful for dumping the grants DB with
# "--skip-extended-insert" while not wasting space in the other dumps
#
# default function (also useful as a template):
#
# ----------
# #
# # if the function already exists, don't redefine it;

#   will be labeled with a number or date, but the files will not
#
# see notes, below, about subdirectory and dumpfile names
#
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "date"
#
###mysql_layout=

#
# subdirectory names, if mysql_layout is a "dir" option, are constructed
#   as follows, within mysql_dumpdir:
# -= if mysql_layout="singledir", the subdirectory will be named
#      [subdirprefix]
# -= if mysql_layout="numberdir", the current (most recent) subdirectory
#      will be named [subdirprefix]
# -= in all other cases, the subdirectories will be named
#      [subdirprefix][filedirsep][number/date]
#
# dumpfile names are constructed as follows, within mysql_dumpdir or the
#   the subdirectory described above (dbname will be omitted if
#   mysql_splitdbs="no"):
# -= if mysql_layout="single" or a "dir" option, the files will be named
#      [fileprefix][dbname][filesuffix]
# -= if mysql_layout="number", the current (most recent) file will be named
#      [fileprefix][dbname][filesuffix]
# -= in all other cases, the files will be named
#      [fileprefix][dbname][filedirsep][number/date][filesuffix]
#
# e.g., if mysql_layout="number", mysql_fileprefix="mydbs-",
# mysql_filedirsep=".", and mysql_suffix=".sql", you could have a file
# named "mydbs-bigdb.3.sql", which would be the 4th oldest copy (including
# the current one) of a database named 'bigdb'
#

#
# prefix to prepend to the names of the database dumpfiles
# (see notes, above)
#
# may not include '/' characters (directories in the path must be in the
# mysql_dumpdir setting, except for "dir"-layout subdirectories)
#
# * can be blank if mysql_splitdbs="yes", or mysql_layout="date", or
#   mysql_layout is not "date" and mysql_filesuffix is not blank
# * if this is unset (as opposed to just blank), it defaults to "mysqldump"
#
###mysql_fileprefix=

#
# suffix to append to the names of the database dumpfiles
# (see notes, above)
#
# usually ".sql" or ".txt"
#
# may not include '/' characters (directories in the path must be in the
# mysql_dumpdir setting, except for "dir"-layout subdirectories)
#
# * can be blank if mysql_splitdbs="yes", or mysql_layout="date", or
#   mysql_layout is not "date" and mysql_fileprefix is not blank
# * if this is unset (as opposed to just blank), it defaults to ".sql"
#
###mysql_filesuffix=

#
# name of the subdirectories to use if mysql_layout is a "dir" option
# (see notes, above)
#
# will have number or date suffixes added if mysql_layout is not "singledir"
#
# may not include '/' characters (directories in the path must be in the
# mysql_dumpdir setting; "dir"-layout subdirectories must be only one layer
# deep)
#
# * ignored if mysql_layout is not a "dir" option
# * can be blank if mysql_layout="datedir"
# * if this is unset (as opposed to just blank), it defaults to "mysqldump"
#
###mysql_subdirprefix=

#
# separator to use before number/date suffixes in dumpfile/subdirectory
# names
# (see notes, above)
#
# may not include '/' characters (directories in the path must be in the
# mysql_dumpdir setting, except for "dir"-layout subdirectories)
#
# * ignored if any of these are true:
#   -= mysql_layout="single" or "singledir"
#   -= mysql_layout="number" or "date", mysql_splitdbs="no", and
#      mysql_fileprefix is blank (see mysql_fileprefix for when that's
#      allowed)
#   -= mysql_layout="datedir" and mysql_subdirprefix is blank
#   (the last two mean that no separator will be used if there's nothing
#   in front of it)
# * can be more than one character, or blank
# * if this is unset (as opposed to just blank), it defaults to "-"
#
###mysql_filedirsep=

#
# format string for the 'date' utility, for dumpfile/subdirectory names
# (see notes, above)
#
# leaving this blank is not recommended because it introduces spaces and
# other punctuation; better is something like "+%Y%m%d" (or "+%Y%m%d%H" if
# backups are run more than once a day); your 'date' utility must support
# whatever string you use
#
# dates refer to when the script starts; all files created during a given
# run of the script will have the same date suffix (or as close as possible;
# 'date' has to be run separately for, e.g., output logs and MySQL dumps)
#
# may not include '/' characters (directories in the path must be in the
# mysql_dumpdir setting, except for "dir"-layout subdirectories)
#
# * ignored if mysql_layout is not "date" or "datedir"
# * can be blank
# * if this is unset (as opposed to just blank), it defaults to "+%Y%m%d"
#
###mysql_filedirdate=

#
# number of dumps to keep, including the current one
#
# 0 means no number limit (but there may still be a date limit; see
# mysql_daysfiles)
#
# note: currently applies only if mysql_layout="number" or "numberdir";
# however, mysql_daysfiles applies to both
#
# * ignored if mysql_layout is not "number" or "numberdir"
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "0"
#
###mysql_numfiles=

#
# days worth of dumps to keep, including the current one
#
# 0 means no days limit (but there may still be a number limit; see
# mysql_numfiles)
#
# dumps older than this many days are removed, first rounding _down_
# to the nearest day
#
# note: _does_ apply to both "number"/"numberdir" and "date"/"datedir"
#
# * ignored if mysql_layout is "single" or "singledir"
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "7"
#
###mysql_daysfiles=

#
# what kind of compression to use: "none", "gzip", "pigz", "bzip2",
# or "lzip"
#
# (lzip is particularly useful because it has features to aid in the
# recovery of damaged files)
#
# if not set to "none", each file will be zipped in place
#
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "gzip"
#
###mysql_zipmode=

#
# additional options to pass to the zip utility
#
# for GNU gzip, "--rsyncable" is useful; other options include "-1" through
# "-9" to tune the size of the file vs. the amount of CPU resources required
# to zip it
#
# * must be an array (see usage notes on the config file)
# * ignored if mysql_zipmode="none"
# * can be blank or unset
#
###mysql_zipoptions=()

#
# when dumping, we can have one of two preservation priorities:
# "data": preserve old data longer, especially in case an error prevents
#         us from obtaining new data
# "space": keep the total disk space usage during the backup process as low
#          as possible
#
# -= in "single"/"singledir" modes, we can use temp files during the dump,
#    then move them into place ("data"), or remove the old files (including
#    zips) before starting it ("space")
# -= the same choice applies if a dump file already exists when it
#    shouldn't, but "warn" or "ignore" modes are set
# -= we can prune old files only after we have finished the current dump
#    ("data"), or remove them before we start it ("space")
#
# * if blank or unset, defaults to "data"
